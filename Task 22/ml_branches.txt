4 branches of Machine Learning

1. Supervised Learning: 
learning to map input data to known targets (annotations)
Examples: optical character recognition, speech recognition,
image classification, and language translation
Sequence generation: give picture- predict caption
Syntax tree prediction: give sentence - predict decomposition
Object detection: give picture - draw bounding box
Image segmentation: give picture - draw pixel-level mask on Object

2. Unsupervised Learning:
finding transformations of input data without targets
aim: data visualizations, data compression, data denoising,
understanding correlations
categories: dimensionality reduction, clustering

3. Self-supervised Learning:
learning without human-annotated labels
use of heuristic algorithm: determines near-optimal solutions
to an optimization problem

4. Reinforcement Learning:
agent receives information about its environment and learns to choose actions 
that will maximize some reward
